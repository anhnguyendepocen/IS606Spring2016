	* Labs are designed to introduce to you doing statistics with R.
	* Answer the questions in the main text as well as the "On Your Own" section.

	* Present one practice problem during our weekly meetups. Signup using the [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xIO-Ofi9AQyVZcK5QABWmEhpGGCC0xpijAD_IA5ESKA/edit).


## The `IS606` R Package

The package can be installed from Github using the `devtools` package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github('jbryer/IS606')
```

### Important Functions

* `library('IS606')` - Load the package
* `vignette(package='IS606')` - Lists vignettes in the IS606 package
* `vignette('os3')` - Loads a PDF of the OpenIntro Statistics book
* `data(package='IS606')` - Lists data available in the package
* `getLabs()` - Returns a list of the available labs
* `viewLab('Lab0')` - Opens Lab0 in the default web browser
* `startLab('Lab0')` - Starts Lab0 (copies to getwd()), opens the Rmd file
* `shiny_demo()` - Lists available Shiny apps

## Using R Markdown

R Markdown files are provided for all the labs. You can start a lab using the `IS606::startLab` function.

However, creating new R Markdown files in RStudio can be done by clicking `File` > `New File` > `R Markdown`.
